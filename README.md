## Getting Started

The guide is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. Follow these steps to build and serve the guide locally:

### 1. Set Up the Environment

Use the provided `env.sh` script to quickly set up a Python virtual environment and install all dependencies:

```sh
source ./env.sh
```

### 2. Run MkDocs Locally

Start a local MkDocs server to preview changes:

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

The site will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
